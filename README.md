This is the Movie DB App.

Interact with the list by tapping on the movie and it will bring you to a page with it's corresponding details including a movie poster,
title, release date, and overview of the movie. You may also like or dislike the movie within the details page.

You can interact with the list by refreshing the page in case movies are updated in the database and also by sorting the movies. You can
sort the movies by title, release date, or by IMDb rating. You can also view a list of only movies that you have liked. Disliking movies
will remove the movie from the liked list if you have liked it previously.
